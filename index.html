                COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some
                people can become severely ill. Although most people with COVID-19 get better within weeks of illness, some people
                experience post-COVID conditions. Post-COVID conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems
                people can experience more than four weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Older people
                and those who have certain underlying medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Vaccines against
                COVID-19 are safe and effective.

                <div class="span-4-1">Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer to protect myself?</div><br><br>
                Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap
                and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and 
                before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at 
                least 60% alcohol.

                People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms â€“ from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear
                2-14 days after exposure to the virus. If you have fever, cough, or other symptoms, you might have COVID-19.
